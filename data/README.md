# Experimental data
The experimental data used to train EPI Suite models are available [here](https://episuite.dev/EpiWebSuite/#/help/associated-databases). We provide an interface to access the data directly within the package. Here's a quote from the EPI Suite website:
> The EPIUnified database holds the combined values from: PhysProp and the available EPI Suiteâ„¢ model Training and Validation sets.  
The data sets available are:  
**WSKOWWIN**: WSKOWWIN Program Methodology & Validation Documents (includes Training & Validation datasets)  
**WaterFragmentDataFiles**: WATERNT (Water Solubility Fragment) Program Methodology & Validation Documents (includes Training & Validation datasets) BioHCwin - estimates biodegradation of hydrocarbons  
**MP-BP-VP-TestSets**: MPBPWIN (Melting Pt, Boiling Pt, Vapor Pressure) Program Test Sets  
**Data_for_BCFBAF**: BCFBAF Excel spreadsheets of BCF and kM data used in training & validation (includes the Jon Arnot Source BCF DB with multiple BCF values)  
**HENRYWIN_Data_EPI**: HENRYWIN Data files used in training & validation (includes Meylan and Howard (1991) Data document)
